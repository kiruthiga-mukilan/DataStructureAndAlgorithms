Non - Linear Sorting Algorithms
Linear Sorting Algorithms - Counting , bucket/bin and Radix Sort

Counting Sort :-
Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then doing some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.

Bucket/Binary Sort :-

Uniformly distribute accross buckets ,  then do InsertionSort on all the buckets and then join

Radix Sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

1. CheckDuplicatesInArray

the number of candidates is less but the number of votes is
significantly large. For this problem we can use counting sort.
