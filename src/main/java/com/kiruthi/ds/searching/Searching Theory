• Unordered Linear Search
• Sorted/Ordered Linear Search
• Binary Search
• Symbol Tables and Hashing
• String Searching Algorithms: Tries, Ternary Search and Suffix Trees

Better for Binary Search:-
interpolation search may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched.

a XOR a XOR a XOR a = 0
a XOR a XOR a = a
Bitonic array -->  first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing
