Priority Queue --> minimum/maximum element among a collection of elements - Job Scheduling
Heap --> Heap is that the value of a node must be > (or <) than the values of its children
         property that all leaves should be at h or h – 1 levels

         Arr[(i-1)/2]	Returns the parent node
         Arr[(2*i)+1]	Returns the left child node
         Arr[(2*i)+2]	Returns the right child node

Applications:
1. HeapSort
2. Priority queues can be efficiently implemented using Binary Heap - Binomoial Heap and Fibonacci Heap
3. Dijkstra’s Shortest Path and Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree
4. a) K’th Largest Element in an array.
   b) Sort an almost sorted array/
   c) Merge K Sorted Arrays.

Min-Heap/Max-Heap --> preorder traversal produces ascending/decending order
