AVL -> BST, whose the difference between left subtree height and right subtree height is at most 1. Log(n) - Self Balancing Tree
Red Balck Tree -->
Splay Tree -->recently accessed nodes in the top of the tree
B-Tree --> sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. used to idex database entries
Agumented Tree -->
Scapegoat Tree -->
Interval Tree -->  maintain set of intervals so that all operations can be done in O(Logn) time.
